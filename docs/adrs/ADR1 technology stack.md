## CONTEXT
To make this payment microservice I need to chose a language and a framework. The language options provided by 
Wefox are: Java, Node, Python, Kotlin and Scala.

I chose Java as language because I have more experience and Spring-Boot as the framework to develop the artifact
because it is one of the most used to develop microservices in the Java World, it provides easy integration with
many of the technologies to integrate and low time to have a functional artifact.
